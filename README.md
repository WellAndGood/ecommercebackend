# Overview

This document describes the components of the backend of an ecommerce application. It applies GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests to sort through products, categories, and tags. 

# Appearance 
Since this is a backend application, there is no visual component. They are all accessible through an API developper such as Insomnia CORE or POSTman.

You can access the `.git` files at:
